## Setup for Code Contributions

### Prerequisites

##### MacOS

-   XCode Command Line Tools `xcode-select --install`
-   If you already have the full Xcode installed, go to menu `Xcode -> Open Developer Tool -> More Developer Tools....`
-   Install Node.js >= 16

##### Windows

-   Install current version of Python3

-   Install Node.js >= 16

##### Linux

-   Install Python > 3.7
-   Install `make`, `gcc`, and `g++`
-   Install Node.js >= 16

#### Repository Setup

-   Fork the project and uncheck the box that says "Copy the `main` branch only". This step is vital as you will not be able to checkout the beta branch if you do not deselect this option. If you accidentally left it checked. Delete the fork you just made and start over.
-   Open a Terminal and navigate to where you want the project repository to exist
-   Clone your forked repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-user>/club_website.git
    ```
-   Navigate into the root directory
    ```sh
    cd club_website
    ```
-   Set the upstream remote
    ```sh
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/nsccs/club_website.git
    ```
-   Switch to beta branch
    ```sh
    git checkout beta
    ```
-   Install required packages
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
-   Start server
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

#### Optional Local Database Setup

Only do these steps if you are actively working on database changes.

-   Install [mariadb community edition](https://mariadb.com/downloads/) for your platform
-   Run the server
-   Run club_website.sql script to add the database and tables. The recommended way is to import the data with mySQL WorkBench.
-   Create a `.env.local` file and add:

```shell
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=<database user>
DB_PASSWORD=<database password>
DB_NAME=club_website
```

If any changes are made to the database please remember to update the setup.sql file to reflect these changes.
Recommended method is with mySQL WorkBench

-   Select _Server_ menu item
-   Select _Data Export_
-   Select the box for _club_website_ and to the right select _Dump Structure Only_
-   Under _Export Options_ select _Export to Self Contained file_ and make sure the path and filename are `<path_to_file>/club_website.sql`
-   Click _Start Export_ button
-   Include file in Pull Request

#### Find Something to Work On

Navigate to the `Issues` tab and use the filters to see open issues. Take note of the `good first issue` and `help wanted` labels. If you decide to start working on an issue, make sure write a comment to let others know!

Also, remember to pull the most recent work from the upstream beta branch before starting your work!

```sh
git pull upstream beta
```

#### Submit a Pull Request

-   Create your feature branch. Please use all lowercase letters with dashes instead of spaces.
    ```sh
    git checkout -b <specific-feature>
    ```
-   Test your feature. Manually test that your feature has not broken anything else in on the site and works as expected.
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
-   Add your work
    ```sh
    git add .
    ```
-   Commit your changes
    ```sh
    git commit -m 'Add a clear and specific message about what the commit contains.'
    ```
-   Push to the branch

    ```sh
    git push origin <specific-feature>
    ```

-   Go to the project Github page to open a pull request. You will select the `nsccs:beta` branch from `<your-repository>:<your-forked-branch>`. Include all the relevant information requested in the template.

-   Request a review from christopher0331, uellenberg, or jaredscarr.

Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!
